(This was a built-in feature on TST 3.3.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Tab Drag Handle provides a small tooltip on tab labels to start dragging of tabs for specific operations. (This was a built-in feature on TST 2.6.0-3.3.6, and now separated.)\n    TST Indent Line provides indent lines like Visual Studio Code's one.\n    TST Open Bookmarks as Partial Tree allows you to open only some bookmarks in a folder as a partial tree. Moreover, it also provides ability to open tree of container tabs from bookmarks.\n    TST-MiddleClick allows you to run \"undo close tab\" or \"close currently active tab\" command on middle click on the sidebar.\n    Tree Style Tab Mouse Wheel allows you to switch active tab by wheel scrolling.\n    Tab flip for Tree Style Tab allows you to move focus to the tab previously focused, by clicking on the active tab.\n    Tree Style Tab Focus Preceding Tab on Close focuses the previous tab instead of the next tab when a tab is closed.\n    Tab Unloader for Tree Style Tab allows you to unload tabs by clicking on them in the sidebar.\n    Move unloaded tabs for Tree Style Tab allows you to move tabs in the sidebar without them becoming active.\n    Tree Style Tab in Separate Window allows you to

custom background color for tabs based on their domain.\n    Add Last Active Class To Tab helps you to give custom appearance for the \"previously active tab\".\n    TSTのタブを閉じるボタンの挙動を変更 (tst-change-close-tab-button-be) allows you to close the parent and its all descendants with a middle click on the closebox of a parent tab, whether the tree is expanded or collapsed.\n    TST Select Random Tab adds a context menu option for selecting a random tab in a Tree Style Tab tree.\n    TST Tab Search provides a search field (as a subpanel) to filter opened tabs in the sidebar.\n    TST Fade Old Tabs sorts all tabs in 3 categories – 'recent', 'older' and 'oldest' by latest visit time, and applies different opacity to them.\n    TST Colorize Tabs allows to set individual color for each tab in order to highlight it.\n    TST New Tabs First puts a newly opened root level at the top of the sidebar.\n\n\nLatest information is available at the
